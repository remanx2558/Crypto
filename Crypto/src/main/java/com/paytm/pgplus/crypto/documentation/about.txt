  1.  //__repr__==reper method to show structure of object : not required
  2.can improve hash code : unique o/p for unique i/p: Hashing.sha256().hashString(String.valueOf(str), StandardCharsets.UTF_8).toString()
  3.can sort objects in hashListObject(arr):
  4.Difficulty ==6 means that generated hash must have 6 zeros in front of it: so generate many hash for same string and then pick with 6 zeros in front
  5.nonce ==difficulty: increase nonce value till it reaches difficulty while generating corresponding hash value a/c to current nonce
  6. nonce goes 0..1..2 ... and goes on inceasing till a hash get generated which have same number of zeros as difficulty
  7. hash of (Block Data+ nonce): keep adjusting nonce
  8.sha256 gives data in hexadecimal---> convert in binary
  9. other can prove the hash is valid if have: nonce+blockdata+algo used to convert(sha256)
  10.Mining rate is more then decrease difficulty so that avg_rage of mining remain same and vice-versa
  11. In PUB-sub : Publisher publish message on a channel and Subscriber listen to a channel both in a network:
  12. Pubsub network reduces the overhead of keeping track of sockets addresses:In this implementation real time socket connections are open between servers and each server has to maintain a list of all Piers.
  13.It has made a real time socket connection with whenever a message broadcast needs to occur between all the peers.
  14.No need to send a direct message to every single peer that has kept track of in the list.
  15.This is a huge amount of work but if this network is sending the same message to all the sockets it doesn't need a targeting messaging capability that is this powerful.
  16.When the network just needs to broadcast something to all the nodes in general :src/main/resources/PubSub Tech.png
  17.Create a Channel called "Block" which is connection of all blockchain nodes
  18.When an individual block chain in the network gets new data in its local chain list it will then publish the block data in the channel
  19.This allows the other nodes to receive that information since they're all subscribed to the same block channel.
  20.Therefore they'll pick up that message of the new block that hit the block and update their own local blocking instances.
