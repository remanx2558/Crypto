  1.  //__repr__==reper method to show structure of object : not required
  2.can improve hash code : unique o/p for unique i/p: Hashing.sha256().hashString(String.valueOf(str), StandardCharsets.UTF_8).toString()
  3.can sort objects in hashListObject(arr):
  4.Difficulty ==6 means that generated hash must have 6 zeros in front of it: so generate many hash for same string and then pick with 6 zeros in front
  5.nonce ==difficulty: increase nonce value till it reaches difficulty while generating corresponding hash value a/c to current nonce
  6. nonce goes 0..1..2 ... and goes on inceasing till a hash get generated which have same number of zeros as difficulty
  7. hash of (Block Data+ nonce): keep adjusting nonce
  8.sha256 gives data in hexadecimal---> convert in binary
  9. other can prove the hash is valid if have: nonce+blockdata+algo used to convert(sha256)
  10.Mining rate is more then decrease difficulty so that avg_rage of mining remain same and vice-versa
